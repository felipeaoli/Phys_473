Click in any region of the contour plot (upper left panel) and you can check:
1. (Upper right): the model prediction and the corresponding values for the free parameters;
2. (Bottom right): the residuals of your fitting ($\text{model}(z_i) - \text{data}_i)/\sigma_i$);
3. (Bottom left): The histogram of residuals and the Gaussian prediction for residuals distribution.

Have fun!
